energetic, short-lived flare observed at submillimetre wavelengths by the
SCUBA-2 instrument on 26 November 2016 (UT). The emission faded by nearly 50%
during the 31 minute integration. The simultaneous source fluxes averaged over
the observation are 500 +/- 107 mJy/beam at 450 microns and 466 +/- 47 mJy/beam
at 850 microns. The 850 micron flux corresponds to a radio luminosity of
$L_{\nu}=8\times10^{19}$ erg/s/Hz, approximately one order of magnitude
brighter (in terms of $\nu L_{\nu}$) than that of a flare of the young star
GMR-A, detected in Orion in 2003 at 3mm. The event may be the most luminous
known flare associated with a young stellar object and is also the first
coronal flare discovered at sub-mm wavelengths. The spectral index between 450
microns and 850 microns of $\alpha = 0.11$ is broadly consistent with
non-thermal emission. The brightness temperature was in excess of
$6\times10^{4}$ K. We interpret this event to be a magnetic reconnection that

$a_1(1260)\to\omega\gamma$, and $a_1(1260)\to\rho\gamma$, are also considered.
An effective meson Lagrangian responsible for $f_1\rho\gamma$,
$f_1\omega\gamma$, $a_1\rho\gamma$ and $a_1\omega\gamma$ interactions is found.
The predicted radiative decay widths, $\Gamma_{f_1\to\rho^0\gamma}=311\

$\Gamma_{a_1\to\rho^0\gamma}=26.8\ \mbox{keV}$,

the hypothesis that $f_1(1285)$ and $a_1(1260)$-mesons have a quark-antiquark

Our result is in remarkably good agreement with the recent data of CLAS

disagrees with the PDG-based estimate of $\Gamma_{f_1\to\rho^0\gamma}=1326\pm

  performance booster of the CERN Large Hadron Collider","21 pages, 14 figures",,,"  The beam aperture of a particle accelerator defines the clearance available
for the circulating beams and is a parameter of paramount importance for the
accelerator performance. At the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the knowledge
and control of the available aperture is crucial because the nominal proton
beams carry an energy of 362 MJ stored in a superconducting environment. Even a
tiny fraction of beam losses could quench the superconducting magnets or cause
severe material damage. Furthermore, in a circular collider, the performance in
terms of peak luminosity depends to a large extent on the aperture of the inner
triplet quadrupoles, which are used to focus the beams at the interaction
points. In the LHC, this aperture represents the smallest aperture at
top-energy with squeezed beams and determines the maximum potential reach of
the peak luminosity. Beam-based aperture measurements in these conditions are
difficult and challenging. In this paper, we present different methods that
have been developed over the years for precise beam-based aperture measurements
in the LHC, highlighting applications and results that contributed to boost the
operational LHC performance in Run 1 (2010-2013) and Run 2 (2015-2018).

  Handschuh",Context-Preserving Text Simplification,,,,"  We present a context-preserving text simplification (TS) approach that
recursively splits and rephrases complex English sentences into a semantic
hierarchy of simplified sentences. Using a set of linguistically principled
transformation patterns, input sentences are converted into a hierarchical
representation in the form of core sentences and accompanying contexts that are
linked via rhetorical relations. Hence, as opposed to previously proposed
sentence splitting approaches, which commonly do not take into account
discourse-level aspects, our TS approach preserves the semantic relationship of
the decomposed constituents in the output. A comparative analysis with the
annotations contained in the RST-DT shows that we are able to capture the
contextual hierarchy between the split sentences with a precision of 89% and
reach an average precision of 69% for the classification of the rhetorical

Andromeda satellite galaxy systems have confirmed the existence of coplanar,
corotating structures of galaxies. In addition to the 'missing satellite
problem', these structures pose a major challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM
scenario of structure formation. We complement the efforts made by the dwarf
galaxy community to extend these studies to other nearby galaxy groups by
systematically searching for faint, unresolved dwarf members with a low surface
brightness in the Southern Centaurus group of galaxies. The aim is to determine
whether these coplanar, corotating structures are a universal phenomenon. We
imaged an area of 60 square degrees (0.3 Mpc$^2$) around the M83 subgroup with
the wide-field Dark Energy Camera (DECam) at the CTIO 4 m Blanco telescope in
$g$ and $r$ down to a limiting surface brightness of $\mu_r\approx 30$ mag
arcsec$^{-2}$. Various image-filtering techniques were applied to the DECam
data to enhance the visibility of extremely low-surface brightness objects. We
report the discovery of 16 new dwarf galaxy candidates in the direction of the
M83 subgroup, roughly doubling the number of known dwarfs in that region. The
photometric properties of the candidates, when compared to those of the Local
Group, suggest membership in the M83 subgroup. The faintest objects have a
central star density of $\approx1.3 L_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ and a total magnitude of
$g = 20.25$, corresponding to $M_g = -9.55$ at the nominal distance of 4.9 Mpc.

states are destroyed by the presence of a large and long-range-correlated
disorder potential, which converts the expected insulator into a metal. We
perform transport measurements in ultrathin, dual-gated topological insulator
films as a function of temperature, gate voltage, and magnetic field, and we
observe a metallic-like, non-quantized conductivity, which exhibits a weak
antilocalization-like cusp at the low magnetic field and gives way to a
nonsaturating linear magnetoresistance at large field. We explain these results
by considering the disordered network of electron- and hole-type puddles
induced by charged impurities. We argue theoretically that such disorder can
produce an insulator-to-metal transition as a function of increasing disorder
strength, and we derive a condition on the band gap and the impurity
concentration necessary to observe the insulating state. We also explain the

discovered high proper-motion white dwarfs by Oppenheimer et al. using a
maximum-likelihood analysis, and discuss the claim that the high-velocity white
dwarfs are members of a halo population with a local density at least ten times
greater than traditionally assumed. We argue that the observations, as
reported, are consistent with the presence of an almost undetected thin disc
plus a thick disc, with densities as conventionally assumed. In addition, there
is a kinematically distinct, flattened, halo population at the more than 99%
confidence level. Surprisingly, the thick disc and halo populations are
indistinguishable in terms of luminosity, color and apparent age (1-10 Gyr).
Adopting a bimodal, Schwarzschild model for the local velocity ellipsoid, with
the ratios sigma_U:sigma_V:sigma_W=1:2/3:1/2, we infer radial velocity
dispersions of sigma_U=62(+8/-10) km/s and 150(+80/-40) km/s (90% C.L.) for the
local thick disc and halo populations, respectively. The thick disc result
agrees with the empirical relation between asymmetric drift and radial velocity
dispersion, inferred from local stellar populations. The local thick-disc plus
halo density of white dwarfs is n^{td+h}=(1.9+-0.5)x10^-3 pc^-3 (90% C.L.), of

  Selected Topics in Signal Processing",,10.1109/JSTSP.2021.3051870,"  Phase retrieval (PR) aims to recover a signal from the magnitudes of a set of
inner products. This problem arises in many audio signal processing
applications which operate on a short-time Fourier transform magnitude or power
spectrogram, and discard the phase information. Recovering the missing phase
from the resulting modified spectrogram is indeed necessary in order to
synthesize time-domain signals. PR is commonly addressed by considering a
minimization problem involving a quadratic loss function. In this paper, we
adopt a different standpoint. Indeed, the quadratic loss does not properly
account for some perceptual properties of audio, and alternative discrepancy
measures such as beta-divergences have been preferred in many settings.
Therefore, we formulate PR as a new minimization problem involving Bregman
divergences. Since these divergences are not symmetric with respect to their
two input arguments in general, they lead to two different formulations of the
problem. To optimize the resulting objective, we derive two algorithms based on
accelerated gradient descent and alternating direction method of multipliers.
Experiments conducted on audio signal recovery from spectrograms that are
either exact or estimated from noisy observations highlight the potential of
our proposed methods for audio restoration. In particular, leveraging some of
these Bregman divergences induce better performance than the quadratic loss
when performing PR from spectrograms under very noisy conditions.

the effect of the solvent in a mean-field fashion with implicit solvent models.
However, a challenge with existing implicit solvent models is that they often
lack accuracy or certain physical properties compared to explicit solvent
models, as the many-body effects of the neglected solvent molecules is
difficult to model as a mean field. Here, we leverage machine learning (ML) and
multi-scale coarse graining (CG) in order to learn implicit solvent models that
can approximate the energetic and thermodynamic properties of a given explicit
solvent model with arbitrary accuracy, given enough training data. Following
the previous ML--CG models CGnet and CGSchnet, we introduce ISSNet, a graph
neural network, to model the implicit solvent potential of mean force. ISSNet
can learn from explicit solvent simulation data and be readily applied to MD
simulations. We compare the solute conformational distributions under different
solvation treatments for two peptide systems. The results indicate that ISSNet
models can outperform widely-used generalized Born and surface area models in
reproducing the thermodynamics of small protein systems with respect to
explicit solvent. The success of this novel method demonstrates the potential

topologically trivial and the other one is topologically active. Topological
quantum phase transition between the gapless phases on the critical line occurs
through the non-trivial multi-critical point in the Lifshitz universality
class. We calculate and analyze the behavior of Wannier state correlation
function close to the multi-critical point and confirm the topological
transition between gapless phases. We show the breakdown of Lorentz invariance

  Metagenomic Timeseries using Sparse Linear Regression",,,10.1371/journal.pone.0102451,"  Human associated microbial communities exert tremendous influence over human
health and disease. With modern metagenomic sequencing methods it is possible
to follow the relative abundance of microbes in a community over time. These
microbial communities exhibit rich ecological dynamics and an important goal of
microbial ecology is to infer the interactions between species from sequence
data. Any algorithm for inferring species interactions must overcome three
obstacles: 1) a correlation between the abundances of two species does not
imply that those species are interacting, 2) the sum constraint on the relative
abundances obtained from metagenomic studies makes it difficult to infer the
parameters in timeseries models, and 3) errors due to experimental uncertainty,
or mis-assignment of sequencing reads into operational taxonomic units, bias
inferences of species interactions. Here we introduce an approach, Learning
Interactions from MIcrobial Time Series (LIMITS), that overcomes these
obstacles. LIMITS uses sparse linear regression with boostrap aggregation to
infer a discrete-time Lotka-Volterra model for microbial dynamics. We tested
LIMITS on synthetic data and showed that it could reliably infer the topology
of the inter-species ecological interactions. We then used LIMITS to
characterize the species interactions in the gut microbiomes of two individuals
and found that the interaction networks varied significantly between
individuals. Furthermore, we found that the interaction networks of the two
individuals are dominated by distinct ""keystone species"", Bacteroides fragilis
and Bacteroided stercosis, that have a disproportionate influence on the
structure of the gut microbiome even though they are only found in moderate
abundance. Based on our results, we hypothesize that the abundances of certain
keystone species may be responsible for individuality in the human gut
microbiome.

time-consuming activities in program debugging. This activity becomes even much
more challenging in Software Product Line (SPL) systems due to variability of
failures. These unexpected behaviors are induced by variability faults which
can only be exposed under some combinations of system features. The interaction
among these features causes the failures of the system. Although localizing
bugs in single-system engineering has been studied in-depth, variability fault
localization in SPL systems still remains mostly unexplored. In this article,
we present VarCop, a novel and effective variability fault localization
approach. For an SPL system failed by variability bugs, VarCop isolates
suspicious code statements by analyzing the overall test results of the sampled
products and their source code. The isolated suspicious statements are the
statements related to the interaction among the features which are necessary
for the visibility of the bugs in the system. The suspiciousness of each
isolated statement is assessed based on both the overall test results of the
products containing the statement as well as the detailed results of the test
cases executed by the statement in these products. On a large dataset of buggy
SPL systems, empirical evaluation shows that VarCop significantly improves two
state-of-the-art fault localization techniques by 33% and 50% in ranking the
incorrect statements in the systems containing a single bug each. In about
two-thirds of the cases, VarCop ranks the buggy statements at the top-3
positions in the resulting lists. For multiple-bug cases, VarCop outperforms
the state-of-the-art approaches 2 times and 10 times in the proportion of bugs
localized at the top-1 positions. In 22% and 65% of the buggy versions, VarCop
correctly ranks at least one bug in a system at the top-1 and top-5 positions.

  phase diversity and false nodes","21 pages, 25 figures",,10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.18573.x,"  Studies based on high-resolution spectroscopic data of rapidly oscillating Ap
stars show a surprising diversity of pulsation behavior in the atmospheric
layers, pointing, in particular, to the co-existence of running and standing
waves. The correct interpretation of these data requires a careful modelling of
pulsations in these magnetic stars. In light of this, in this work we present a
theoretical analysis of pulsations in roAp stars, taking into account the
direct influence of the magnetic field. We derive approximate analytical
solutions for the displacement components parallel and perpendicular to the
direction of the magnetic field, that are appropriate to the outermost layer.
From these, we determine the expression for the theoretical radial velocity for
an observer at a general position, and compute the corresponding pulsation
amplitude and phase as function of height in the atmosphere. We show that the
integral for the radial velocity has contributions from three different types
of wave solutions, namely, running waves, evanescent waves, and standing waves
of nearly constant amplitude. We then consider a number of case studies to
illustrate the origin of the different pulsational behaviour that is found in
the observations. Concerning pulsation amplitude, we find that it generally
increases with atmospheric height. Pulsation phase, however, shows a diversity
of behaviours, including phases that are constant, increasing, or decreasing
with atmospheric height. Finally, we show that there are situations in which
the pulsation amplitude goes through a zero, accompanied by a phase jumps of
$\pi$, and argue that such behaviour does not correspond to a pulsation node in
the outermost layers of the star, but rather to a visual effect, resulting from
the observers inability to resolve the stellar surface.

of machine learning to estimate different nuisance functions and hence allow
for fewer restrictions on the underlying structure of the data. To limit a
potential overfitting bias that may result when using machine learning methods,
cross-fitting estimators have been proposed. This includes the splitting of the
data in different folds to reduce bias and averaging over folds to restore
efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, it is not yet clear how exactly the
data should be split and averaged. We employ a Monte Carlo study with different
data generation processes and consider twelve different estimators that vary in
sample-splitting, cross-fitting and averaging procedures. We investigate the
performance of each estimator independently on four different meta-learners:
the doubly-robust-learner, R-learner, T-learner and X-learner. We find that the
performance of all meta-learners heavily depends on the procedure of splitting
and averaging. The best performance in terms of mean squared error (MSE) among
the sample split estimators can be achieved when applying cross-fitting plus
taking the median over multiple different sample-splitting iterations. Some
meta-learners exhibit a high variance when the lasso is included in the ML
methods. Excluding the lasso decreases the variance and leads to robust and at
least competitive results.

radio galaxies, LERGs). While LERGs can achieve a wide range of $\Pi_{\rm

$\Pi_{\rm 1.4\,GHz} \lesssim 15\%$. A difference in $\Pi_{\rm 1.4\,GHz}$ is
also seen when the sample is divided at 0.5% of the total Eddington-scaled
accretion rate, where the weakly accreting sources can attain higher values of
$\Pi_{\rm 1.4\,GHz}$. We do not find any clear evidence that this is driven by
intrinsic magnetic field differences of the different radio morphological
classes. Instead, we attribute the differences in $\Pi_{\rm 1.4\,GHz}$ to the
local environments of the radio sources, in terms of both the ambient gas
density and the magnetoionic properties of this gas. Thus, not only are
different large-scale gaseous environments potentially responsible for the
different accretion states of HERGs and LERGs, we argue that the large-scale

Moreover, we prove the rigidity phenomenon arising from this inequality.
Lastly, as an application, we discuss immersed minimal surfaces in hyperbolic
3--manifolds and these discussions lead us to results similar to A. Sanders'

1011.0061,Gerard Hooft 't,Gerard 't Hooft,The Conformal Constraint in Canonical Quantum Gravity,,,,"  Perturbative canonical quantum gravity is considered, when coupled to a
renormalizable model for matter fields. It is proposed that the functional
integral over the dilaton field should be disentangled from the other
integrations over the metric fields. This should generate a conformally
invariant theory as an intermediate result, where the conformal anomalies must
be constrained to cancel out. When the residual metric is treated as a
background, and if this background is taken to be flat, this leads to a novel
constraint: in combination with the dilaton contributions, the matter
lagrangian should have a vanishing beta function. The zeros of this beta
function are isolated points in the landscape of quantum field theories, and so
we arrive at a denumerable, or perhaps even finite, set of quantum theories for
matter, where not only the coupling constants, but also the masses and the
cosmological constant are all fixed, and computable, in terms of the Planck

how the interplay between large-scale advection, small-scale turbulence and

consider a cellular flow with a moisture source at a boundary. The
statistically steady state attained shows features reminiscent of the Hadley

leads directly to a robust, falsifiable prediction for the correlation between
stellar fraction (fstar) and total system mass (M500) of galaxy groups and
clusters. This prediction is relatively insensitive to the details of baryonic
physics or cosmological parameters. In particular, if the fstar-M500 relation
is fixed and does not evolve with redshift, CDM models predict the logarithmic
slope of this relation to be b>-0.3. This constraint can be weakened if the
fstar-M500 relation evolves strongly, but this implies more stars must be
formed in situ in groups at low redshift. Conservatively requiring that at
least half the stars in groups were formed by z=1, the constraint from
evolution models is b>-0.35. Since the most massive clusters (M500=1E15 Msun)
are observed to have fstar=0.01, this means that groups with M500=5E13 Msun
must have fstar<0.03. Recent observations by Gonzalez et al. (2007) indicate a
much steeper relation, with fstar>0.04 in groups, leading to b=-0.64. If
confirmed, this would rule out hierarchical structure formation models: today's
clusters could not have been built from today's groups, or even from the
higher-redshift progenitors of those groups. We perform a careful analysis of
these and other data to identify the most important systematic uncertainties in
their measurements. Although correlated uncertainties on stellar and total
masses might explain the steep observed relation, the data are only consistent
with theory if the observed group masses are systematically underestimated.

studied here. RRLS identified by the OGLE II survey are used to estimate their
number density distribution in the bar region of the LMC. To find their
location, I estimated the scale-height of their distribution in the LMC using
extinction corrected average magnitudes of ab type stars. The density is found
to vary differently along and across the bar of the LMC, and the difference is
found to be statistically significant. The density distribution is found to be
elongated like the LMC bar and the position angle (PA) of the elongation is
estimated to be 112.$^o$5 $\pm$ 15.$^o$3. This value of PA is found to be same
as the PA$_{maj}$ of the bar, within the errors, estimated using red clump
stars and giants. The ellipticity of their density distribution is estimated to
be $\sim$ 0.5, very similar to the ellipticity of the bar, estimated from
giants. The above results show that majority of the population of RRLS in the
central region of the LMC are found to have the signature of the bar. This
result could mean that most of these stars are located in the disk, considering
the bar as a disk feature. On the other hand, their scale-height was found to
be 3.0$\pm 0.9$ kpc. This indicates that RRLS are located in the halo and not
in the disk. Thus these stars in the inner LMC have halo-like location and a
disk-like density distribution. I discuss some possible formation scenarios for
this puzzling combination.

difficult to detect in the presence of noise. This problem is alleviated if one
can observe samples from multiple realizations of the nonzero values for the

a price, however, since each new realization adds new unknown nonzero values,
thus increasing uncertainty. In this paper, upper and lower bounds on joint
sparsity pattern estimation are derived. These bounds, which improve upon
existing results even in the absence of diversity, illustrate key tradeoffs
between the number of measurements, the accuracy of estimation, and the
diversity. It is shown, for instance, that diversity introduces a tradeoff
between the uncertainty in the noise and the uncertainty in the nonzero values.
Moreover, it is shown that the optimal amount of diversity significantly
improves the behavior of the estimation problem for both optimal and
computationally efficient estimators.

and then commits to it. The seller's goal is to maximize the expected revenue.
We study the problem in two settings. (1) The seller targets buyers of a
certain type. In this case, finding the optimal advertising strategy is
equivalent to finding the concave closure of a simple function. The function is
a product of two quantities, the likelihood ratio and the cost of uncertainty.
Based on this observation, we prove some properties of the optimal mechanism,
which allow us to solve for the optimal mechanism by a finite-size convex
program. The convex program will have a polynomial-size if the state of the
world has a constant number of possible realizations or the buyers face a
decision problem with a constant number of options. For the general problem, we
prove that it is NP-hard to find the optimal mechanism. (2) When the seller
faces buyers of different types and only knows the distribution of their types,
we provide an approximation algorithm when it is not too hard to predict the
possible type of buyers who will make the purchase. For the general problem, we
prove that it is NP-hard to find a constant-factor approximation.

devices composed of several superconducting or/and normal metal leads separated
by quantum dots. Starting from a microscopic Hamiltonian description, we
provide a non-perturbative approach to quantum electronic transport in the

integral formulation, the lead degrees of freedom are integrated out in order
to compute both the current and the current correlations (noise) in this class
of systems, in terms of the dressed Green's function matrix of the quantum
dots. In order to illustrate the efficiency of this formalism, we apply our
results to the ""all superconducting Cooper pair beam splitter"", a device
composed of three superconducting leads connected via two quantum dots, where
crossed Andreev reflection operates Cooper pair splitting. Commensurate voltage
differences between the three leads allow to obtain expressions for the current
and noise as a function of the Keldysh Nambu Floquet dressed Green's function
of the dot system. This voltage configuration allows the occurrence of
non-local processes involving multiple Cooper pairs which ultimately lead to
the presence of non-zero DC currents in an out-of-equilibrium situation. We
investigate in details the results for the noise obtained numerically in the
specific case of opposite voltages, where the transport properties are
dominated by the so called ""quartet processes"", involving the coherent exchange
of two Cooper pairs among all three superconducting terminals. We show that
these processes are noiseless in the non-resonant case, and that this property
is also observed for other voltage configurations. When the dots are in a
resonant regime, the noise characteristics change qualitatively, with the
appearance of giant Fano factors.

to a sample spanning network. The rheology of this gel primarily exhibits a

Binding energies and radii of the ground and low-excited states are obtained as

replaced by an expanding phase with a drastic violation of the Null Energy
Condition (NEC): \dot H >> H^2. The model is based on the recently introduced
Galileon theories, that allow NEC violating solutions without instabilities.
The unperturbed solution describes a Universe that is asymptotically Minkowski
in the past, expands with increasing energy density until it exits the regime
of validity of the effective field theory and reheats. This solution is a
dynamical attractor and the Universe is driven to it, even if it is initially
contracting. The study of perturbations of the Galileon field reveals some
subtleties, related to the gross violation of the NEC and it shows that
adiabatic perturbations are cosmologically irrelevant. The model, however,
suggests a new way to produce a scale invariant spectrum of isocurvature
perturbations, which can later be converted to adiabatic: the Galileon is
forced by symmetry to couple to the other fields as a dilaton; the effective
metric it yields on the NEC violating solution is that of de Sitter space, so
that all light scalars will automatically acquire a nearly scale-invariant
spectrum of perturbations.

teleparallel theory. The expression for the dynamical energy-momentum density
is identical to that for the canonical energy-momentum density in general
relativity up to leading order terms on the boundary of a large sphere
including the gravitational source, and the loss of dynamical energy-momentum,
which is the generator of \emph{internal} translations, is the same as that of
the canonical energy-momentum in general relativity. Under certain asymptotic
conditions for a non-dynamical Higgs-type field $\psi^{k}$, the loss of
``spin'' angular momentum, which is the generator of \emph{internal} $SL(2,C)$
transformations, is the same as that of angular momentum in general relativity,
and the losses of canonical energy-momentum and orbital angular momentum, which
constitute the generator of Poincar\'{e} \emph{coordinate} transformations, are
vanishing. The results indicate that our definitions of the dynamical
energy-momentum and angular momentum densities in this extended new general
relativity work well for gravitational wave radiations, and the extended new
general relativity accounts for the Hulse-Taylor measurement of the pulsar
PSR1913+16.

couplings accessible at the Large Hadron Collider. New fermions that affect
Higgs couplings lead to vacuum instability of the Higgs potential. Above the
scale of vacuum instability, bosonic states must stabilize the potential,
implying a cut-off to the pure fermion model. Conservatively tuning the models
to produce the maximal cut-off for a given Higgs coupling effect, we show that
observing a deviation in the $Htt$, $H$-diphoton, or $H$-digluon coupling,
larger than 20$%$, would require that new bosons exist in order to stabilize
the Higgs potential below about 100 TeV. For generic parameter configurations,

new bosons are absent up to a high scale, then a deviation in the $Hbb$ or

sizable deviation in the $Zbb$ or $Z\tau\tau$ couplings that can be

produce appropriate mixer designs. Here we discuss two methods - laser ablation

the Galactic plane by $\gamma$-ray observations. Photons of $\gamma$-ray
wavelengths are particularly well suited for geometrical and kinematic studies
of the Milky Way because they are not subject to extinction by interstellar gas
or dust. Here, we use the radioactive decay line of $\mathrm{^{26}Al}$ at
$1.809\,\mathrm{MeV}$ to perform maximum likelihood fits to data from the
spectrometer SPI on board the INTEGRAL satellite as a proof-of-concept study.
Our simple analytic 3D emissivity models are line-of-sight integrated, and
varied as a function of the Sun's vertical position, given a known distance to
the Galactic centre. We find a vertical position of the Sun of $z_0 = 15 \pm
17\,\mathrm{pc}$ above the Galactic plane, consistent with previous studies,
finding $z_0$ in a range between $5$ and $29\,\mathrm{pc}$. Even though the
sensitivity of current MeV instruments is several orders of magnitude below
that of telescopes for other wavelengths, this result reveals once more the
disregarded capability of soft $\gamma$-ray telescopes. We further investigate
possible biases in estimating the vertical extent of $\gamma$-ray emission if
the Sun's position is set incorrectly, and find that the larger the true
extent, the less is it affected by the observer position. In the case of
$\mathrm{^{26}Al}$ with an exponential scale height of $150,\mathrm{pc}$
($700\,\mathrm{pc}$) in the inner (full) Galaxy, this may lead to misestimates
of up to $25\,\%$.

While various ion ratios would be consistent with collisional ionization

high-velocity absorption components indicate that T ~ 9000 K -- so the gas is
not in CIE. Analysis of the C II fine-structure excitation equilibrium yields

those found for gas at similar velocities toward 23 Ori and tau CMa, and also
with several models for shocked gas. While the shock models can reproduce some

can in polynomial time find a set $F \subseteq E(G)$ that contains an optimal

a theory without quartic self interactions of gauge bosons or for a smaller

particular, while entanglement and non-local correlations are properties of
states, both arise from symmetries of global operators that commute with the
system Hamiltonian. Here, we introduce a framework for completely classifying
the local and non-local properties of all such global operators, given the
Hamiltonian and a bi-partitioning of the system. This framework is limited to
descriptions based on stabilizer quantum codes, but may be generalized. We
illustrate the use of this framework to study entanglement and non-local

agents) and agents with no inputs (passive agents), where active and passive
agent roles are considered to be interchangeable in order to capture a wide
array of applications. A challenge in the control of active-passive multiagent
systems is the presence of information exchange uncertainties that can yield to
undesirable closed-loop system performance. Motivated by this standpoint, this
paper proposes an adaptive control algorithm for this class of multiagent
systems to suppress the negative effects of information exchange uncertainties.
Specifically, by estimating these uncertainties, the proposed adaptive control
architecture has the ability to recover the active-passive multiagent system
performance in a distributed manner. As a result, the agents converge to a
user-adjustable neighborhood of the average of the applied inputs to the active
agents. The efficacy of the proposed control architecture is also validated
from a human-robot collaboration perspective, where a human is visiting several
task locations, and the multiagent system identifies these locations and moves
toward them as a coverage control problem.

$c$-number $\theta^{\mu\nu}$ is inconsistent from a theoretical point of view.
Consistent algebras are obtained by promoting $\theta^{\mu\nu}$ to an
anti-symmetric tensor operator ${\hat\theta}^{\mu\nu}$. The simplest among them
is Doplicher-Fredenhagen-Roberts (DFR) algebra in which the triple commutator
among the coordinate operators is assumed to vanish. This allows us to define
the Lorentz-covariant operator fields on the DFR algebra as operators diagonal
in the 6-dimensional $\theta$-space of the hermitian operators,
${\hat\theta}^{\mu\nu}$. It is shown that we then recover Carlson-Carone-Zobin
(CCZ) formulation of the Lorentz-invariant non-commutative gauge theory with no
need of compactification of the extra 6 dimensions. It is also pointed out that
a general argument concerning the normalizability of the weight function in the
Lorentz metric leads to a division of the $\theta$-space into two disjoint
spaces not connected by any Lorentz transformation so that the CCZ covariant
moment formula holds true in each space, separately. A non-commutative
generalization of Connes' two-sheeted Minkowski space-time is also proposed.

Since the non-Abelian gauge bosons are massless there is no exponential

  abstract to suit",,10.1103/PhysRevE.82.066110,"  Cascades on random networks are typically analyzed by assuming they map onto
percolation processes and then are solved using generating function
formulations. This approach assumes that the network is infinite and weakly
connected, yet furthermore approximates a dynamic cascading process as a static
percolation event. In this paper we propose a dynamic Markov model formulation
that assumes a finite network with arbitrary average nodal degree. We apply it
to the case where cascades follow a threshold rule, that is, that a node will
change state (""flip"") only if a fraction, exceeding a given threshold, of its
neighbors has changed state previously. The corresponding state transition
matrix, recalculated after each step, records the probability that a node of
degree k has i flipped neighbors after j steps in the cascade's evolution. This
theoretical model reproduces a number of behaviors observed in simulations but
not yet reported in the literature. These include the ability to predict
cascades in a domain previously predicted to forbid cascades without assuming
that the network is locally tree-like, and, due to the dynamic nature of the
model, a ""near death"" behavior in which cascades initially appear about to die
but later explode. Cascades in the ""no cascades"" region require a sufficiently
large seed of initially flipped nodes whose size scales with the size of the
network or else the cascade will die out. Our theory also predicts the well
known properties of cascades, for instance that a single node seed can start a
global cascade in the appropriate regime regardless of the (finite) size of the
network. The theory and simulations developed here are compared with a
foundational paper by Watts which used generating function theory.

corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 101 fb$^{-1}$, collected in
2017-2018 with the CMS detector. Machine learning techniques are used to define
separate categories for events with narrow jets from initial-state radiation
and events with large-radius jets consistent with a hadronic decay of a W or Z
boson. A statistical combination is made with an earlier search based on a data
sample of 36 fb$^{-1}$, collected in 2016. No significant excess of events is
observed with respect to the standard model background expectation determined
from control samples in data. The results are interpreted in terms of limits on
the branching fraction of an invisible decay of the Higgs boson, as well as
constraints on simplified models of dark matter, on first-generation scalar
leptoquarks decaying to quarks and neutrinos, and on models with large extra
dimensions. Several of the new limits, specifically for spin-1 dark matter

from the Wide imaging survey ($ \sim 121~ $deg$^2$) performed with a part of
the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). We find that only two
out of 151 quasars reside in regions that are more overdense compared to the
average field at $ > 4 \sigma $. The distributions of the distance between
quasars and the nearest protoclusters and the significance of the overdensity
at the position of quasars are statistically identical to those found for
$g$-dropout galaxies, suggesting that quasars tend to reside in almost the same
environment as star-forming galaxies at this redshift. Using stacking analysis,
we find that the average density of $g$-dropout galaxies around quasars is
slightly higher than that around $g$-dropout galaxies on $1.0 - 2.5$ pMpc
scales, while at $ < 0.5$ pMpc that around quasars tends to be lower. We also
find that quasars with higher UV-luminosity or with more massive black holes
tend to avoid the most overdense regions, and that the quasar near zone sizes
are anti-correlated with overdensity. These findings are consistent with a
scenario in which the luminous quasar at $z \sim4 $ resides in structures that
are less massive than those expected for the progenitors of today's rich
clusters of galaxies, and possibly that luminous quasars may be suppressing
star formation in their close vicinity.

threshold, consistent with the simulation results, that provides a valuable
insight into how the microscopic dynamics of the model determine the observed
macroscopic phenomena published previously. The dynamics of the Tangled Nature
model is defined on the microevolutionary time scale via reproduction, with
heredity, variation, and natural selection. Each organism reproduces with a
rate that is linked to the individuals' genetic sequence and depends on the
composition of the population in genotype space. Thus the microevolutionary
dynamics of the fitness landscape is regulated by, and regulates, the evolution
of the species by means of the mutual interactions. At low mutation rate, the
macro evolutionary pattern mimics the fossil data: periods of stasis, where the
population is concentrated in a network of coexisting species, is interrupted
by bursts of activity. As the mutation rate increases, the duration and the
frequency of bursts increases. Eventually, when the mutation rate reaches a
certain threshold, the population is spread evenly throughout the genotype
space showing that natural selection only leads to multiple distinct species if
adaptation is allowed time to cause fixation.

(CMB) experiments will have the power to improve on current constraints on
neutrino masses and provide new limits on neutrino degeneracy parameters. The
latter could surpass those derived from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the
observationally-inferred primordial helium abundance. These conclusions derive
from our Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) simulations which incorporate a full
BBN nuclear reaction network. This provides a self-consistent treatment of the
helium abundance, the baryon number, the three individual neutrino degeneracy
parameters and other cosmological parameters. Our analysis focuses on the
effects of gravitational lensing on CMB constraints on neutrino rest mass and
degeneracy parameter. We find for the PLANCK experiment that total (summed)
neutrino mass $M_{\nu} > 0.29$ eV could be ruled out at $2\sigma$ or better.
Likewise neutrino degeneracy parameters $\xi_{\nu_{e}} > 0.11$ and $|
\xi_{\nu_{\mu/\tau}} | > 0.49$ could be detected or ruled out at $2\sigma$
confidence, or better. For POLARBEAR we find that the corresponding detectable
values are $M_\nu > 0.75 {\rm eV}$, $\xi_{\nu_{e}} > 0.62$, and $|
\xi_{\nu_{\mu/\tau}}| > 1.1$, while for EPIC we obtain $M_\nu > 0.20 {\rm eV}$,
$\xi_{\nu_{e}} > 0.045$, and $|\xi_{\nu_{\mu/\tau}}| > 0.29$. Our forcast for
EPIC demonstrates that CMB observations have the potential to set constraints
on neutrino degeneracy parameters which are better than BBN-derived limits and
an order of magnitude better than current WMAP-derived limits.

the one-dimensional $p$-model, the two-dimensional $p$-model and the fractional
Brownian motions. We find that both approaches have comparable performances to
unveil the fractal and multifractal nature. In other words, without loss of
accuracy, the multifractal spectrum $f(\alpha)$ can be directly determined
using the new approach with less computation cost. We also apply the new MF-DMA
approach to the volatility time series of stock prices and confirm the presence

we present GeoChemFoam's novel numerical model for simulation of conjugate heat
transfer in micro-CT images of porous media. GeoChemFoam uses the
micro-continuum approach to describe the fluid-solid interface using the volume
fraction of fluid and solid in each computational cell. The velocity field is
solved using Brinkman's equation with permeability calculated using the
Kozeny-Carman equation which results in a near-zero permeability in the solid
phase. Conjugate heat transfer is then solved with heat convection where the
velocity is non-zero, and the thermal conductivity is calculated as the
harmonic average of phase conductivity weighted by the phase volume fraction.
Our model is validated by comparison with the standard two-medium approach for
a simple 2D geometry. We then simulate conjugate heat transfer and calculate
heat transfer coefficients for different flow regimes and injected fluid
analogous to injection into a geothermal reservoir in a micro-CT image of

one splits the notion of $\mu $-completeness into pieces, and asks for a
uniform ultrafilter over $\mu $ satisfying just some piece of $\mu
$-completeness.
  Analogue local versions of weak compactness are harder to come by, since weak
compactness cannot be defined by using a single ultrafilter. We deal with the
problem by restricting just to a subset $P$ of all the partitions of $\mu $
into $<\mu $ classes and asking for some ultrafilter $D$ over $\mu $ such that
no partition in $P$ disproves the $\mu $-completeness of $D$. By making $P$
vary in appropriate classes, one gets both measurability and weak compactness,

measurability which are at the same time weaker and local. Of particular

improvements in safety, energy efficiency, and time utilization. However, their
net effect on energy and environmental outcomes is unclear. Higher fuel economy
reduces the energy required per mile of travel, but it also reduces the fuel
cost of travel, incentivizing more travel and causing an energy ""rebound
effect."" Moreover, CAVs are predicted to vastly reduce the time cost of travel,
inducing further increases in travel and energy use. In this paper, we forecast
the induced travel and rebound from CAVs using data on existing travel
behavior. We develop a microeconomic model of vehicle miles traveled (VMT)
choice under income and time constraints; then we use it to estimate
elasticities of VMT demand with respect to fuel and time costs, with fuel cost
data from the 2017 United States National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) and
wage-derived predictions of travel time cost. Our central estimate of the
combined price elasticity of VMT demand is -0.4, which differs substantially
from previous estimates. We also find evidence that wealthier households have
more elastic demand, and that households at all income levels are more
sensitive to time costs than to fuel costs. We use our estimated elasticities
to simulate VMT and energy use impacts of full, private CAV adoption under a
range of possible changes to the fuel and time costs of travel. We forecast a
2-47% increase in travel demand for an average household. Our results indicate
that backfire - i.e., a net rise in energy use - is a possibility, especially
in higher income groups. This presents a stiff challenge to policy goals for
reductions in not only energy use but also traffic congestion and local and
global air pollution, as CAV use increases.

science community. However, the exiting studies about promoting information
spreading seldom took into account the human memory, which plays an important
role in the spreading dynamics. In this paper we propose a non-Markovian
information spreading model on complex networks, in which every informed node
contacts a neighbor by using the memory of neighbor's accumulated contact
numbers in the past. We systematically study the information spreading dynamics
on uncorrelated configuration networks and a group of $22$ real-world networks,
and find an effective contact strategy of promoting information spreading,
i.e., the informed nodes preferentially contact neighbors with small number of
accumulated contacts. According to the effective contact strategy, the high
degree nodes are more likely to be chosen as the contacted neighbors in the
early stage of the spreading, while in the late stage of the dynamics, the
nodes with small degrees are preferentially contacted. We also propose a
mean-field theory to describe our model, which qualitatively agrees well with
the stochastic simulations on both artificial and real-world networks.

deployed authentication, e.g., PINs or Android patterns. In a simulated
attacker setting, 2x3 grids offered no additional security, but blocklisting

locations and formulating an asynchronous, distributed receiver beamforming at
the UAV to compute the Direction of Arrival (DoA) from the unknown transmitter.
The proposed method includes four steps: 1) Blind detection and extraction of
unique signature in the signal to be localized, 2) Asynchronous signal
acquisition and conditioning, 3) DoA calculation by creating a virtual
distributed antenna array at UAV and 4) Obtaining position fix of emitter using
DoA from two locations. These steps are analyzed for various sources of error,
computational complexity and compared with widely used signal subspace-based
DoA estimation algorithms. RFEye is implemented using an Intel-Aero UAV,

magnetic components grow at high frequencies, differently from the values of
the response functions to the well known ordinary components that decrease at
high frequencies. Thus the magnetic components could in principle become the
dominant part of the signal at high frequencies. This is important for a
potential detection of the signal at high frequencies and confirms that the
magnetic contributions must be taken into account in the data analysis. More,

fact that multiple matter-wave dark solitons may naturally form in such

we study the dark soliton interactions and show that the dynamics of
well-separated solitons (i.e., ones that undergo a collision with relatively
low velocities) can be analyzed by means of particle-like equations of motion.
The latter take into regard the repulsion between solitons (via an effective
repulsive potential) and the confinement and dimensionality of the system (via
an effective parabolic trap for each soliton). Next, based on the fact that
stationary, well-separated dark multi-soliton states emerge as a nonlinear
continuation of the appropriate excited eigensates of the quantum harmonic
oscillator, we use a Bogoliubov-de Gennes analysis to systematically study the
stability of such structures. We find that for a sufficiently large number of
atoms, multiple soliton states may be dynamically stable, while for a small
number of atoms, we predict a dynamical instability emerging from resonance
effects between the eigenfrequencies of the soliton modes and the intrinsic
excitation frequencies of the condensate. Finally we present experimental
realizations of multi-soliton states including a three-soliton state consisting

Observatory (LIGO) detected a gravitational-wave transient (GW150914); we
characterize the properties of the source and its parameters. The data around
the time of the event were analyzed coherently across the LIGO network using a
suite of accurate waveform models that describe gravitational waves from a
compact binary system in general relativity. GW150914 was produced by a nearly
equal mass binary black hole of $36^{+5}_{-4} M_\odot$ and $29^{+4}_{-4}
M_\odot$; for each parameter we report the median value and the range of the
90% credible interval. The dimensionless spin magnitude of the more massive
black hole is bound to be $<0.7$ (at 90% probability). The luminosity distance
to the source is $410^{+160}_{-180}$ Mpc, corresponding to a redshift
$0.09^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ assuming standard cosmology. The source location is
constrained to an annulus section of $610$ deg$^2$, primarily in the southern
hemisphere. The binary merges into a black hole of $62^{+4}_{-4} M_\odot$ and
spin $0.67^{+0.05}_{-0.07}$. This black hole is significantly more massive than
any other inferred from electromagnetic observations in the stellar-mass
regime.

(MOND)--a proposed alternative to dark matter, which posits a breakdown of
Newtonian dynamics in the limit of small accelerations. In particular, I point
the reasons for thinking that MOND is an effective theory--perhaps, despite
appearance, not even in conflict with GR. I then contrast the two
interpretations of MOND as modified gravity and as modified inertia. I describe
two mechanical models that are described by potential theories similar to
(non-relativistic) MOND: a potential-flow model, and a membrane model. These
might shed some light on a possible origin of MOND. The possible involvement of
vacuum effects is also speculated on.

for society. The complex soundscapes in the hospital produce unpleasant noise,
which may exceed the prescribed noise level for the patients and healthcare
professionals. Previous studies have reported that extended exposure to loud
noise may cause auditory and nonauditory disorders in healthcare professionals,
medical staff, and patients. Therefore, there is an increased interest for the
design and fabrication of effective noise barriers for the hospital premises.
Herein, we have performed the thorough experimental investigations on the
acoustical performances for PVC coated polyester fabrics and 100 % pure PVC
sheets. The performances of these potential acoustic curtains have found to be
superior to that of existing acoustic curtains for hospitals. Also, the results
showed that the sound transmission class rating of PVC curtains are much higher
than the existing commercial acoustic curtains.

hinge on tuning parameters that are difficult to calibrate. In particular,
existing calibration schemes in the logistic regression framework lack any

scheme for $\ell_1$-penalized logistic regression. It is based on simple tests
along the tuning parameter path and is equipped with optimal guarantees for
feature selection. It is also amenable to easy and efficient implementations,
and it rivals or outmatches existing methods in simulations and real data

solutions since a field redefinition in the Schwarzian theory transforms its
equation of motion into the time independent part of the bulk Einstein
equation. The deformations of the $AdS_2$ boundary as a function of the
boundary time are exactly the conformal factor of the $AdS_2$ black hole metric

  Solution for VSC",,,,"  In order to improve dynamic characteristics of the power system with
high-proportion renewable energy sources (RESs), it is necessary for the
voltage source converter (VSC), interfaces of RESs, to provide inertial and
frequency regulation. In practical applications, VSCs are better to be
controlled as a current source due to its weak overcurrent capacity. According
to the characteristic, a dual synchronous theory is proposed to analyze the
synchronization between current sources in this paper. Based on dual
synchronous idea, a dual synchronous generator (DSG) control is applied in VSC
to form inertial current source. In addition, a braking control is embedded in
DSG control to improve the transient stability of VSC. Finally, experimental
results verify the effectiveness of the theory and the control method.

1808.04990,Thomas Wihler,Pascal Heid and Thomas P. Wihler,Adaptive Iterative Linearization Galerkin Methods for Nonlinear Problems,,,,"  A wide variety of (fixed-point) iterative methods for the solution of
nonlinear equations (in Hilbert spaces) exists. In many cases, such schemes can
be interpreted as iterative local linearization methods, which, as will be
shown, can be obtained by applying a suitable preconditioning operator to the
original (nonlinear) equation. Based on this observation, we will derive a
unified abstract framework which recovers some prominent iterative schemes. In
particular, for Lipschitz continuous and strongly monotone operators, we derive
a general convergence analysis. Furthermore, in the context of numerical
solution schemes for nonlinear partial differential equations, we propose a
combination of the iterative linearization approach and the classical Galerkin
discretization method, thereby giving rise to the so-called iterative
linearization Galerkin (ILG) methodology. Moreover, still on an abstract level,
based on two different elliptic reconstruction techniques, we derive a
posteriori error estimates which separately take into account the
discretization and linearization errors. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive
algorithm, which provides an efficient interplay between these two effects. In
addition, the ILG approach will be applied to the specific context of finite
element discretizations of quasilinear elliptic equations, and some numerical
experiments will be performed.

is organized around a set of pre-defined properties: accuracy of individual

divergence variable, representation of the energy and enstrophy spectra, and
simulation of nonlinear dynamics. The results confirm that the scheme is
between the first and second order accurate, and conserves the total energy and
potential enstrophy up to the time truncation errors. The scheme is capable of
producing more physically realistic energy and enstrophy spectra, indicating
that the new scheme can help prevent the unphysical energy cascade towards the
finest resolvable scales. With an optimal representation of the dispersive wave
relations, the scheme is able to keep the flow close to being non-divergent,
maintain the geostrophically balanced structures with large-scale geophysical

  WMAP beam","12 pages, 18 figures",,10.1088/1475-7516/2015/05/012,"  A number of studies of WMAP and Planck have highlighted that the power at the
low multipoles in CMB power spectrum are lower than their theoretically
predicted values. Possible angular correlation between the orientations of
these low multipoles have also been claimed. It is important to investigate the
possibility that the power deficiency at low multipoles may not be of
primordial origin and is only an observation artifact coming from the scan
procedure adapted in the WMAP or Planck satellites. Therefore, its always
important to investigate all the observational artifacts that can mimic them.
The CMB dipole which is almost 550 times higher than the quadrupole can leak to
the higher multipoles due to the non-symmetric beam shape of the WMAP. In this
paper a formalism has been developed and simulations are carried out to study
the effect of the non-symmetric beam on this power transfer. It is interesting
to observed that a small but non-negligible amount of power from the dipole can
get transferred to the quadrupole and the higher multipoles due to the
non-symmetric beam. It is shown that in case of WMAP scan strategy the shape of
the quadrupole coming due to this power leakage is very much similar to the
observed quadrupole from WMAP data. Simulations have also been carried out for
Planck scan strategy. It is seen that for Planck scan strategy the power
transfer is not only limited to the quadrupole but also to a few higher low
multipoles. Since the actual beam shapes of Planck are not publicly available
we present results in terms of upper limits on asymmetric beam parameters that
would contaminate of the quadrupole power at the level of $1\mu K$.

the gain in fine tuning which they enable compared to extensions of the
Standard Model with colored top partners. Estimates show that, at least in the
simplest realizations of the TH idea, the separation between the mass of new
colored particles and the electroweak scale is controlled by the coupling
strength of the underlying UV theory, and that a parametric gain is achieved
only for strongly-coupled dynamics. Motivated by this consideration we focus on
one of these simple realizations, namely composite TH theories, and study how
well such constructions can reproduce electroweak precision data. The most
important effect of the Twin states is found to be the infrared contribution to
the Higgs quartic coupling, while direct corrections to electroweak observables
are sub-leading and negligible. We perform a careful fit to the electroweak
data including the leading-logarithmic corrections to the Higgs quartic up to
three loops. Our analysis shows that agreement with electroweak precision tests
can be achieved with only a moderate amount of tuning, in the range 5-10\%, in
theories where colored states have mass of order 3-5 TeV and are thus out of
reach of the LHC. For these levels of tuning, larger masses are excluded by a
perturbativity bound, which makes these theories possibly discoverable, hence
falsifiable, only at a future 100 TeV collider.

apart. These `beads' are found in a tail-like feature that is perpendicular to
the disk of NGC 2856, which implies that it was formed from material accreted
from the companion NGC 2854. The extreme blueness of the optical/UV colors and
redness of the mid-infrared colors implies very young stellar ages (~4 - 20
Myrs) for these star forming regions. Spectral decomposition of these `beads'
shows excess emission above the modeled stellar continuum in the 3.6 micron and
4.5 micron bands, indicating either contributions from interstellar matter to
these fluxes or a second older stellar population. These clumps have -12.0 <

suggests that bridge material falling into the potential of the companion
overshoots the companion. The gas then piles up at apo-galacticon before
falling back onto the companion, and star formation occurs in the pile-up. A

their mechanical properties in response to loading to prevent failure. They
smartly control the addition of material in locations of high stress by
utilizing locally available resources guided by biological signals. On the
contrary, synthetic structural materials have unchanging mechanical properties
limiting their mechanical performance and service life. Here, a material system
that autonomously adapts its mechanical properties in response to mechanical
loading is reported inspired by the mineralization process of bone. It is
observed that charges from piezoelectric scaffolds can induce mineralization
from media with mineral ions. The material system adapts to mechanical loading
by inducing mineral deposition in proportion to the magnitude of the loading
and the resulting piezoelectric charges. Moreover, the mechanism allows a
simple one-step route for making graded materials by controlling stress
distribution along the scaffold. The findings can pave the way for a new class
of self-adaptive materials that reinforce the region of high stress or induce
deposition of minerals on the damaged areas from the increase in stress to
prevent/mitigate failure. They can also contribute to addressing the current
challenges of synthetic materials for load-bearing applications from

tackling the gravitational field's quantization. The first problem is the lack
of a genuine gravitational variable representing gravitation only, inertial
forces apart. The second problem is its incompatibility with quantum mechanics,
a problem inherited from the more fundamental conflict of special relativity
with quantum mechanics. A procedure to overcome these difficulties is outlined,
which amounts to replacing general relativity with its teleparallel equivalent
and the Poincar\'e-invariant special relativity with the de Sitter-invariant
special relativity. Those replacements give rise to the de Sitter-modified
teleparallel gravity, which does not have the two mentioned problems. It can
thus be considered an improved alternative approach to quantum gravity.

learning, signal processing, statistics, scientific computing, and cloud
computing. The multidimensional feature and huge volume of big data put urgent
requirements to the development of multilinear modeling tools and efficient
algorithms. In this paper, we build a novel multilinear tensor space that
supports useful algorithms such as SVD and QR, while generalizing the matrix
space to fourth-order tensors was believed to be challenging. Specifically,
given any multidimensional discrete transform, we show that fourth-order
tensors are bilinear operators on a space of matrices. First, we take a
transform-based approach to construct a new tensor space by defining a new
multiplication operation and tensor products, and accordingly the analogous
concepts: identity, inverse, transpose, linear combinations, and orthogonality.
Secondly, we define the $\mathcal{L}$-SVD for fourth-order tensors and present
an efficient algorithm, where the tensor case requires a stronger condition for
unique decomposition than the matrix case. Thirdly, we define the tensor
$\mathcal{L}$-QR decomposition and propose a Householder QR algorithm to avoid
the catastrophic cancellation problem associated with the conventional
Gram-Schmidt process. Finally, we validate our schemes on video compression and
one-shot face recognition. For video compression, compared with the existing
tSVD, the proposed $\mathcal{L}$-SVD achieves $3\sim 10$dB gains in RSE, while
the running time is reduced by about $50\%$ and $87.5\%$, respectively. For
one-shot face recognition, the recognition rate is increased by about $10\%
\sim 20\%$.

  Clusters",14 pages,,,"  Large-scale storage cluster systems need to manage a vast amount of data
locations. A naive data locations management maintains pairs of data ID and
nodes storing the data in tables. However, it is not practical when the number
of pairs is too large. To solve this problem, management using data
distribution algorithms, rather than management using tables, has been proposed
in recent research. It can distribute data by determining the node for storing
the data based on the datum ID. Such data distribution algorithms require the
ability to handle the addition or removal of nodes, short calculation time and
uniform data distribution in the capacity of each node. This paper proposes a
data distribution algorithm called ASURA (Advanced Scalable and Uniform storage
by Random number Algorithm) that satisfies these requirements. It achieves
following four characteristics: 1) minimum data movement to maintain data
distribution according to node capacity when nodes are added or removed, even
if data are replicated, 2) roughly sub-micro-seconds calculation time, 3) much
lower than 1% maximum variability between nodes in data distribution, and 4)
data distribution according to the capacity of each node. The evaluation
results show that ASURA is qualitatively and quantitatively competitive against
major data distribution algorithms such as Consistent Hashing, Weighted
Rendezvous Hashing and Random Slicing. The comparison results show benefits of
each algorithm; they show that ASURA has advantage in large scale-out storage
clusters.

described as a cylinder of height (i.e. the thickness of the lobe) and diameter
of 6.5 and 6.0x10^{16} cm, respectively. We also mapped the blue-shifted
component of He I 10830 seen towards the NW lobe. Contrary to previous works,
we suggested that this blue-shifted component is not related to the Paddle but
it is indeed in the equatorial disc.
  We confirmed the claim of Smith (2005) and showed that the spatial extent of
the Little Homunculus matches remarkably well the radio continuum emission at 3
cm, indicating that the Little Homunculus can be regarded as a small HII
region. Therefore, we used the optically-thin 1.3 mm radio flux to derive a
lower limit for the number of Lyman-continuum photons of the central source in
Eta Car. In the context of a binary system, and assuming that the ionising flux
comes entirely from the hot companion star, the lower limit for its spectral
type and luminosity class ranges from O5.5 III to O7 I. Moreover, we showed
that the radio peak at 1.7 arcsec NW from the central star is in the same
line-of-sight of the `Sr-filament' but they are obviously spatially separated,
while the blue-shifted component of He I 10830 may be related to the radio peak

some debatable issues concerning the so-called Photometric Plane for bulges and
elliptical galaxies in different forms and various versions of the famous
Kormendy relation.
  We show that some of the correlations under discussion are artificial
(self-correlations), while others truly reveal some new essential details of
the structural properties of galaxies. Our main results are as follows:
  (1) At present, we can not conclude that faint stellar discs are, on average,
more thin than discs in high surface brightness galaxies. The ``central surface
brightness -- thickness'' correlation appears only as a consequence of the
transparent exponential disc model to describe real galaxy discs.
  (2) The Photometric Plane appears to have no independent physical sense.
Various forms of this plane are merely sophisticated versions of the Kormendy
relation or of the self-relation involving the central surface brightness of a
bulge/elliptical galaxy and the Sersic index n.
  (3) The Kormendy relation is a physical correlation presumably reflecting the
difference in the origin of bright and faint ellipticals and bulges.

color of quasars as a function of their projected separation from foreground
galaxies, extending to comoving separations of ~10Mpc/h, which they interpret
as a signature of reddening by intergalactic dust. We present theoretical
models of this remarkable observation, using SPH cosmological simulations of a
(50Mpc/h)^3 volume. Our primary model uses a simulation with galactic winds and
assumes that dust traces the intergalactic metals. The predicted galaxy-dust
correlation function is similar in form to the galaxy-mass correlation
function, and reproducing the MSFR data requires a dust-to-metal mass ratio of
0.24, about half the value in the Galactic ISM. Roughly half of the reddening
arises in dust that is more than 100Kpc/h from the nearest massive galaxy. We
also examine a simulation with no galactic winds, which predicts a much smaller
fraction of intergalactic metals (3% vs. 35%) and therefore requires an
unphysical dust-to-metal ratio of 2.18 to reproduce the MSFR data. In both
models, the signal is dominated by sightlines with E(g-i)=0.001-0.1. The
no-wind simulation can be reconciled with the data if we also allow reddening
to arise in galaxies up to several x 10^10 Msun. The wind model predicts a mean
visual extinction of A_V ~0.0133 mag out to z=0.5, with a
sightline-to-sightline dispersion similar to the mean, which could be
significant for future supernova cosmology studies. Reproducing the MSFR
results in these simulations requires that a large fraction of ISM dust survive
its expulsion from galaxies and its residence in the intergalactic medium.
Future observational studies that provide higher precision and measure the
dependence on galaxy type and environment will allow detailed tests for models
of enriched galactic outflows and the survival of IG dust.

$\tfrac{m}{r(M)}$ unless $m = 0$, in which case $d(M)= 0$. A matroid is
density-critical if all of its proper minors of non-zero rank have lower
density. By a 1965 theorem of Edmonds, a matroid that is minor-minimal among
simple matroids that cannot be covered by $k$ independent sets is
density-critical. It is straightforward to show that $U_{1,k+1}$ is the only
minor-minimal loopless matroid with no covering by $k$ independent sets. We
prove that there are exactly ten minor-minimal simple obstructions to a matroid
being able to be covered by two independent sets. These ten matroids are
precisely the density-critical matroids $M$ such that $d(M) > 2$ but $d(N) \le
2$ for all proper minors $N$ of $M$. All density-critical matroids of density
less than $2$ are series-parallel networks. For $k \ge 2$, although finding all
density-critical matroids of density at most $k$ does not seem straightforward,
we do solve this problem for $k=\tfrac{9}{4}$.

that in the regions of steady 2D flow where viscous forces are small and
streamlines are closed, the vorticity is constant. In this paper, we extend
this theorem to recirculating flows with quasi-periodic time dependence using
ergodic and geometric analysis of Lagrangian dynamics. In particular, we show
that 2D quasi-periodic viscous flows, in the limit of zero viscosity, cannot
converge to recirculating inviscid flows with non-uniform vorticity
distribution. A corollary of this result is that if the vorticity contours form
a family of closed curves in a quasi-periodic viscous flow, then at the limit
of zero viscosity, vorticity is constant in the area enclosed by those curves
at all times.

significantly over a 10 magnitude range in AGN optical luminosity, faint and
bright AGN must reside in dark matter halos with similar masses. The halos that
host bright and faint AGN therefore have similar intrinsic abundances, and the
large observed variation in AGN number density with luminosity reflects a
change in duty cycle.

  Peng","Learning Environmental Sounds with Multi-scale Convolutional Neural
  Network",accepted by IJCNN 2018,,,"  Deep learning has dramatically improved the performance of sounds
recognition. However, learning acoustic models directly from the raw waveform
is still challenging. Current waveform-based models generally use time-domain
convolutional layers to extract features. The features extracted by single size
filters are insufficient for building discriminative representation of audios.
In this paper, we propose multi-scale convolution operation, which can get
better audio representation by improving the frequency resolution and learning
filters cross all frequency area. For leveraging the waveform-based features
and spectrogram-based features in a single model, we introduce two-phase method
to fuse the different features. Finally, we propose a novel end-to-end network
called WaveMsNet based on the multi-scale convolution operation and two-phase
method. On the environmental sounds classification datasets ESC-10 and ESC-50,
the classification accuracies of our WaveMsNet achieve 93.75% and 79.10%
respectively, which improve significantly from the previous methods.

sharp exponential order $C\lambda^4t$ of the second moment of the exact
solution of the stochastic heat equation with multiplicative noise and periodic

to inherit numerically these intrinsic properties of the original equation, we
introduce a fully discrete scheme, whose spatial direction is based on the
finite difference method and temporal direction is based on the
$\theta$-scheme. We prove that the second moment of numerical solutions of both
spatially semi-discrete and fully discrete schemes grows at least as
$\exp\{C\lambda^2t\}$ and at most as $\exp\{C\lambda^4t\}$ for large $t$ under
natural conditions, which implies the weak intermittency of these numerical
solutions. Moreover, a renewal approach is applied to show that both of the
numerical schemes could preserve the sharp exponential order $C\lambda^4t$ of
the second moment of the exact solution for large spatial partition number.

  light at z ~ 4","17 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables. Accepted to MNRAS",,10.1093/mnras/stab038,"  With the advent of deep optical-to-near-infrared extragalactic imaging on the
degree scale, samples of high-redshift sources are being selected that contain
both bright star-forming (SF) galaxies and faint active galactic nuclei (AGN).
In this study we investigate the transition between SF and AGN-dominated
systems at $z \simeq 4$ in the rest-frame UV. We find a rapid transition to
AGN-dominated sources bright-ward of $M_{\rm UV} \simeq -23.2$. The effect is
observed in the rest-frame UV morphology and size-luminosity relation, where
extended clumpy systems become point-source dominated, and also in the
available spectra for the sample. These results allow us to derive the
rest-frame UV luminosity function for the SF and AGN-dominated sub-samples. We
find the SF-dominated LF is best fit with a double-power law, with a lensed
Schechter function being unable to explain the existence of extremely luminous
SF galaxies at $M_{\rm UV} \simeq -23.5$. If we identify AGN-dominated sources
according to a point-source morphology criterion we recover the relatively flat
faint-end slope of the AGN LF determined in previous studies. If we instead
separate the LF according to the current spectroscopic AGN fraction, we find a
steeper faint-end slope of $\alpha = -1.83 \pm 0.11$. Using a simple model to
predict the rest-frame AGN LF from the $z = 4 $ galaxy LF we find that the
increasing impact of host galaxy light on the measured morphology of faint AGN
can explain our observations.

J175107.6-294037) belonging to the AM CVn class in the Galactic Bulge Survey.
Deep archival X-ray observations constrain the X-ray positional uncertainty of
the source to 0.57 arcsec, and allow us to uniquely identify the optical and UV
counterpart. Optical spectroscopic observations reveal the presence of broad,
shallow He i absorption lines while no sign of hydrogen is present, consistent
with a high state system. We present the optical lightcurve from Optical
Gravitational Lensing Experiment monitoring, spanning 15 years. It shows no
evidence for outbursts; variability is present at the 0.2 mag level on
timescales ranging from hours to weeks. A modulation on a timescale of years is
also observed. A Lomb-Scargle analysis of the optical lightcurves shows two
significant periodicities at 22.90 and 23.22 min. Although the physical
interpretation is uncertain, such timescales are in line with expectations for
the orbital and superhump periods. We estimate the distance to the source to be
between 0.5 - 1.1 kpc. Spectroscopic follow-up observations are required to
establish the orbital period, and to determine whether this source can serve as
a verification binary for the eLISA gravitational wave mission.

velocities. This result is also confirmed by a calculation using a
tight-binding model. Furthermore, by changing a parameter in the system while
preserving time-reversal symmetry, we show that two Fermi arcs evolve into a
surface Dirac cone when the system transits from the Weyl semimetal to the
topological insulator phase. We also demonstrate that choices of surface
terminations affect the pairing of Weyl nodes, from which the Fermi arcs are
formed.
