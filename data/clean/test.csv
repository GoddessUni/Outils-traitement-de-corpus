"  Interaction of molecules with light may lead to electronic transitions and
simultaneous vibrational excitations. Franck-Condon factors (FCFs) play an
important role in quantifying the intensities of such vibronic transitions
occurring during molecular photo-excitations. In this article, we describe a
general method for estimating FCFs using a quantum information processor. The
method involves the application of a translation operator followed by the
measurement of certain projections. We also illustrate the method by
experimentally estimating FCFs with the help of a three-qubit NMR quantum
information processor. We describe two methods for the measurement of
projections - (i) using diagonal tomography and (ii) using Moussa protocol. The
experimental results agree fairly well with the theory.

"  We discuss the prospect of deblending microlensing events by observing
astrometric shifts of the lensed stars. Since microlensing searches are
generally performed in very crowded fields, it is expected that stars will be
confusion limited rather than limited by photon statistics. By performing
simulations of events in crowded fields, we find that if we assume a dark lens
and that the lensed star obeys a power law luminosity function, $n(L)\propto
L^{-\beta}$, over half the simulated events show a measurable astrometric
shift. Our simulations included 20000 stars in a $256\times 256$ Nyquist
sampled CCD frame. For $\beta=2$, we found that 58% of the events were
significantly blended $(F_{\ast}/F_{tot}\leq 0.9)$, and of those, 73% had a
large astrometric shift $(\geq 0.5 pixels)$. Likewise, for $\beta=3$, we found
that 85% of the events were significantly blended, and that 85% of those had
large shifts. Moreover, the shift is weakly correlated to the degree of
blending, suggesting that it may be possible not only to detect the existence
of a blend, but also to deblend events statistically using shift information.

"  The distribution function of particles over clusters is proposed for a system
of identical intersecting spheres, the centres of which are uniformly
distributed in space. Consideration is based on the concept of the rank number
of clusters, where the rank is assigned to clusters according to the cluster
sizes. Distribution is universal in the sense that it does not depend on
boundary conditions and is valid for infinite medium. The form of the
distribution function is determined by only one parameter, equal to the ratio
of the sphere radius (`interaction radius') to the average distance between the
centres of the spheres. This parameter plays also a role of the order
parameter. It is revealed under what conditions the universal distribution
behaves like well known log-normal distribution. Applications of the proposed
distribution to some realistic physical situations, which are close to the
conditions of the gas condensation to liquid, are considered.

"  One crucial problem in relativistic astrophysics is that of the nature of
black hole candidates. It is usually assumed that astrophysical black holes are
described by the Schwarzschild or Kerr space-times; however, there is no direct
evidence to assert this. Moreover, there are various solutions in general
relativity that can be alternatives to black holes, usually called black hole
mimickers. In this work, we study the shadow produced by a compact object
described by the q-metric, which is the simplest static and axially symmetric
solution of Einstein equations with a non-vanishing quadrupole moment. This
particular spacetime has the property of containing an independent parameter
$q$, which is related to the compact object deformation. The solution
corresponds to naked singularities for some specific values of this parameter.
Additionally, we analyze the eigenvalues of the Riemann tensor using the
$SO(3,C)$ representation, which allows us to find, in an invariant way, regions
where there may be repulsive effects. Furthermore, we numerically solve the
motion equations to show the shadow, the Einstein ring, and the gravitational
lensing to establish a possible signature of such repulsive effects. We found
that as $q$ is smaller, the Einstein ring decreases, but the shape is the same
as the Schwarzschild black hole case. However, for values of $q$ lower or equal
than $-0.5$, repulsive gravitational effects appear in the gravitational
lensing close to the compact object, where a strong dependence of the system to
the initial conditions seems to take place.

To this aim, we will characterise and model the magnetic fields, magnetospheric

As a new application we calculate the expected number of Gabriel (or full)

"  The problems and paradoxes of the Lifshitz theory in application to real
dielectric and semiconductor materials are reviewed. It is shown that the
inclusion of drift current of conduction electrons into the model of dielectric
response results in contradictions with both thermodynamics and experimental
data of different experimental groups. Physical reasons why the problems and
paradoxes arise are analyzed and found to be connected with the violation of
basic applicability condition of the Lifshitz theory, the thermal equilibrium.
A recent alternative approach to the resolution of the problems based on the
inclusion of screening effects and diffusion current is considered and
demonstrated to be thermodynamically and experimentally inconsistent. It is
argued that the inclusion of the diffusion current leads to an even deeper
violation of thermal equilibrium. Phenomenologically, the Lifshitz theory with

"  While single-image super-resolution (SISR) has attracted substantial interest
in recent years, the proposed approaches are limited to learning image priors
in order to add high frequency details. In contrast, multi-frame

advantage, along with the increasing popularity of burst photography, have made
MFSR an important problem for real-world applications.
  We propose a novel architecture for the burst super-resolution task. Our
network takes multiple noisy RAW images as input, and generates a denoised,
super-resolved RGB image as output. This is achieved by explicitly aligning
deep embeddings of the input frames using pixel-wise optical flow. The
information from all frames are then adaptively merged using an attention-based
fusion module. In order to enable training and evaluation on real-world data,
we additionally introduce the BurstSR dataset, consisting of smartphone bursts
and high-resolution DSLR ground-truth. We perform comprehensive experimental

"  We propose a stochastic multipath model for the received signal for the case
where the transmitter and receiver, both with directive antennas, are situated

responses with a gradual specular-to-diffused transition in delay. Mirror
source theory predicts the arrival rate to be quadratic in delay, inversely
proportional to room volume and proportional to the product of the antenna beam
coverage fractions. We approximate the mirror source positions by a homogeneous
spatial Poisson point process and their gain as complex random variables with
the same second moment. The multipath delays in the resulting model form an
inhomogeneous Poisson point process which enables derivation of the
characteristic functional, power/kurtosis delay spectra, and the distribution
of order statistics of the arrival delays in closed form. We find that the
proposed model matches the mirror source model well in terms of power delay
spectrum, kurtosis delay spectrum, order statistics, and prediction of mean
delay and rms delay spread. The constant rate model, assumed in e.g. the
Saleh-Valenzuela model, is unable to reproduce the same effects.

"  We discuss the characteristics of known extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars in
the Galaxy using the Stellar Abundances for Galactic Archaeology (SAGA)
database (Suda et al. 2008, PASJ, 60, 1159).The analyses of carbon-enhanced
stars in our sample suggest that the nucleosynthesis in AGB stars can
contribute to the carbon enrichment in a different way depending on whether the
metallicity is above or below [Fe/H] ~ -2.5, which is consistent with the
current models of stellar evolution at low metallicity. We find the transition
of the initial mass function at [Fe/H] ~ -2 in the viewpoint of the
distribution of carbon abundance and the frequency of carbon-enhanced stars.
For observed EMP stars, we confirmed that some, not all, of observed stars
might have undergone at least two types of extra mixing to change their surface
abundances. One is to deplete the lithium abundance during the early phase of
red giant branch. Another is to decrease the C/N ratio by one order of
magnitude during the red giant branch phase. Observed small scatters of
abundances for alpha-elements and iron-group elements suggest that the chemical
enrichment of our Galaxy takes place in a well-mixed interstellar medium. We
find that the abundance trends of alpha-elements are highly correlated with
each other, while the abundances of iron-group elements are subject to
different slopes relative to the iron abundance. This implies that the
supernova yields of alpha-elements are almost independent of mass and
metallicity, while those of iron-group elements have a metallicity dependence
or mass dependence with the variable initial mass function.The occurrence of
the hot bottom burning in the mass range of 5 <~ M / Msun <~ 6 is consistent
with the initial mass function of the Galaxy peaked at ~ 10 - 12 Msun to be
compatible with the statistics of carbon enhanced stars with and without

"  Black hole masses are tightly correlated with the stellar velocity
dispersions of the bulges which surround them, and slightly less-well
correlated with the bulge luminosity. It is common to use these correlations to
estimate the expected abundance of massive black holes. This is usually done by
starting from an observed distribution of velocity dispersions or luminosities
and then changing variables. This procedure neglects the fact that there is
intrinsic scatter in these black hole mass--observable correlations. Accounting
for this scatter results in estimates of black hole abundances which are larger
by almost an order of magnitude at masses >10^9 M_sun. Including this scatter
is particularly important for models which seek to infer quasar lifetimes and
duty cycles from the local black hole mass function. However, even when scatter
has been accounted for, the M_bh-sigma relation predicts fewer massive black
holes than does the M_bh-L relation. This is because the sigma-L relation in
the black hole samples currently available is inconsistent with that in the
SDSS sample from which the distributions of L or sigma are based: the black
hole samples have smaller L for a given sigma, or larger sigma for a given L.
The sigma-L relation in the black hole samples is similarly discrepant with
that in other samples of nearby early-type galaxies. This suggests that current
black hole samples are biased: if this is a selection rather than physical
effect, then the M_bh-sigma and M_bh-L relations currently in the literature
are also biased from their true values.

"  The three cosmological conjectures to which our work refers are: the
phenomenon called geodesic incompleteness, the physical gravitational
$\theta_G$-term that would characterize the 1-parameter family of inequivalent
vacua of quantum gravidynamics, and the hypothesis of multiversality, more
specifically, a zero-energy multiverse.
  The known cosmological phenomenology leads under plausible assumptions to
theorems which establish that the universe is past incomplete. Here, starting
from Wilczek's definition of multiverse (a larger physical structure of which
the universe forms part) and that spacetime is much larger than the observable
universe, in a new sense suggested by these theorems, we place the observable
universe, labelled by $U_{\theta_G^{(1)}}$, within a multiverse ensemble,
$\{U_{\theta_G}\}$. Its topological $\theta_G^{(1)}$-term would characterize
the observable universe from the Planck epoch until the present time, and it
could have physical effects in, for example, black-hole physics.
  Our proposal is therefore a possible framework for a multiverse quantum
cosmology, in which the temporal parameters (see figures in the main text)
start from a ""timeless multiverse big bang"" (TLMBB), where all members of the
multiverse ensemble, $\{U_{\theta_G}\}$, disappear, together with their
corresponding classical spacetimes. Since quantum cosmology can be viewed as
one attempt among many to face with the question of finding a gravitational
quantum theory, if the TLMBB were the appropriate ground to define the physical
or mathematical underlying structure of quantum cosmology, then multiversality
could come to have a predictive power within our observable universe.

"  We model the phase-space of the kinematic tracers using general, smooth
distribution functions to derive a conservative lower bound on the total mass
within 150-200 kpc.
  By approximating the potential as Keplerian, the phase-space distribution can
be simplified to that of a smooth distribution of energies and eccentricities.
Our approach naturally allows for calculating moments of the distribution
function, such as the radial profile of the orbital anisotropy. We construct a
family of phase-spaces with the resulting radial velocity dispersion
overlapping with that of distant kinematic tracers, while making no assumptions
about the density of the tracers and the radial profile of the velocity
anisotropy (beta).
  While there is no apparent upper bound for the Milky Way mass, at least as
long as only the radial motions are concerned, we find a sharp lower bound for
the mass that is small. In particular, a mass value of $2.4 \times 10^{11}$ of
solar masses, is still consistent with the dispersion profile at larger radii.
  Compared with much greater mass values in the literature, this result shows
that determining the Milky Way mass is strongly model dependent. We expect a
similar reduction of mass estimates in models assuming more realistic mass
profiles.

$10^{-7}$ Gauss. This estimate may increase to the level of $10^{-6}$ Gauss if
more extreme galactic parameters, and subsequent shear amplification of the

able to confine relativistic particles over times longer than the age of the

A2B2F7 pyrochlore materials, NaSrMn2F7, NaCaFe2F7, and NaSrFe2F7 are presented.
In these compounds, either S=2 Fe2+ or S=5/2 Mn2+ is on the B site, while
nonmagnetic Na and Ca (Na and Sr) are disordered on the A site. The materials,
which were grown as crystals via the floating zone method, display high
effective magnetic moments and large Curie-Weiss thetas. Despite these
characteristics, freezing of the magnetic spins, characterized by peaks in the
susceptibility or specific heat, is not observed until low temperatures. The
empirical frustration index, f=- {\theta}cw/Tf, for the materials are 36
(NaSrMn2F7), 27 (NaSrFe2F7), and 19 (NaCaFe2F7). AC susceptibility, DC
susceptibility, and heat capacity measurements are used to characterize the
observed spin glass behavior. The results suggest that the compounds are
frustrated pyrochlore antiferromagnets with weak bond disorder. The magnetic
phenomena that these fluoride pyrochlores exhibit, in addition to their
availability as relatively large single crystals, make them promising
candidates for the study of geometric magnetic frustration.

"  We propose an efficient way to output better calibrated uncertainty scores
from neural networks. The Distilled Dropout Network (DDN) makes standard
(non-Bayesian) neural networks more introspective by adding a new training loss
which prevents them from being overconfident. Our method is more efficient than
Bayesian neural networks or model ensembles which, despite providing more
reliable uncertainty scores, are more cumbersome to train and slower to test.
We evaluate DDN on the the task of image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset
and show that our calibration results are competitive even when compared to 100
Monte Carlo samples from a dropout network while they also increase the
classification accuracy. We also propose better calibration within the state of
the art Faster R-CNN object detection framework and show, using the COCO
dataset, that DDN helps train better calibrated object detectors.

"  Current benchmarks for optical flow algorithms evaluate the estimation either
directly by comparing the predicted flow fields with the ground truth or
indirectly by using the predicted flow fields for frame interpolation and then
comparing the interpolated frames with the actual frames. In the latter case,
objective quality measures such as the mean squared error are typically
employed. However, it is well known that for image quality assessment, the
actual quality experienced by the user cannot be fully deduced from such simple
measures. Hence, we conducted a subjective quality assessment crowdscouring
study for the interpolated frames provided by one of the optical flow
benchmarks, the Middlebury benchmark. We collected forced-choice paired
comparisons between interpolated images and corresponding ground truth. To
increase the sensitivity of observers when judging minute difference in paired
comparisons we introduced a new method to the field of full-reference quality
assessment, called artefact amplification. From the crowdsourcing data, we
reconstructed absolute quality scale values according to Thurstone's model. As
a result, we obtained a re-ranking of the 155 participating algorithms w.r.t.
the visual quality of the interpolated frames. This re-ranking not only shows
the necessity of visual quality assessment as another evaluation metric for
optical flow and frame interpolation benchmarks, the results also provide the
ground truth for designing novel image quality assessment (IQA) methods
dedicated to perceptual quality of interpolated images. As a first step, we
proposed such a new full-reference method, called WAE-IQA. By weighing the
local differences between an interpolated image and its ground truth WAE-IQA
performed slightly better than the currently best FR-IQA approach from the
literature.

thickness, $d$, regimes are identified: 20 uc $\lesssim d$ uc where the system
is bulk like, a transition region 8 uc $\le d \lesssim 20$ uc where the FMR
line width and position depend on thickness and $d=6$ uc which displays
significantly altered magnetodynamic properties, while still displaying bulk
magnetization. Magnetization and FMR measurements are consistent with a
nonmagnetic volume corresponding to $\sim$ 4 uc. We observe a reduction of
Curie temperature ($T_C$) with decreasing thickness, which is coherent with a
mean field model description. The reduced ordering temperature also accounts
for the thickness dependence of the magnetic anisotropy constants and resonance
fields. The damping of the system is strongly thickness dependent, and is for
thin films dominated by thickness dependent anisotropies, yielding both a
strong 2-magnon scattering close to $T_c$ and a low temperature broadening. For
the bulk like samples a large part of the broadening can be linked to spread in
magnetic anisotropies attributed to crystal imperfections/domain boundaries of
the bulk like film.

redshift survey, using a redshift-space friends-of-friends algorithm. We
optimize the friends-of-friends linking lengths to recover galaxy systems that
occupy the same dark matter halos, using a set of mock catalogs created by
populating halos of N-body simulations with galaxies. Extensive tests with
these mock catalogs show that no combination of perpendicular and line-of-sight
linking lengths is able to yield groups and clusters that simultaneously
recover the true halo multiplicity function, projected size distribution, and
velocity dispersion. We adopt a linking length combination that yields, for
galaxy groups with ten or more members: a group multiplicity function that is
unbiased with respect to the true halo multiplicity function; an unbiased
median relation between the multiplicities of groups and their associated
halos; a spurious group fraction of less than ~1%; a halo completeness of more
than ~97%; the correct projected size distribution as a function of
multiplicity; and a velocity dispersion distribution that is ~20% too low at
all multiplicities. These results hold over a range of mock catalogs that use
different input recipes of populating halos with galaxies. We apply our

$\Sigma^{\prime\prime}\sim(\omega^2+\pi^2T^2)^a$ with $a=1$ in the overdoped
Fermi-liquid state and $a<0.5$ in the optimal to underdoped regime. We show
that this non-Fermi-liquid scaling behavior can naturally be explained by the
presence of a scale-invariant state of matter known as unparticles. We evaluate
analytically the electron self-energy due to interactions with fermionic
unparticles. We find that, in agreement with experiments, the imaginary part of
the self-energy scales with respect to temperature and energy as
$\Sigma^{\prime\prime}\sim T^{2+2\alpha}$ and $\omega^{2+2\alpha}$, where
$\alpha$ is the anomalous dimension of the unparticle propagator. In addition,
the calculated occupancy and susceptibility of fermionic unparticles, unlike
those of normal fermions, have significant spectral weights even at high
energies. This unconventional behavior is attributed to the branch cut in the
unparticle propagator which broadens the unparticle spectral function over a
wide energy range and non-trivially alters the scattering phase space by
enhancing (suppressing) the intrinsic susceptibility at low energies for
negative (positive) $\alpha$. Our work presents new evidence suggesting that
unparticles might be important low-energy degrees of freedom in strongly

We demonstrate that this source of CP violation is compatible with existing

"  New calculations of radiative rates and electron impact excitation cross
sections for Fe XI are used to derive emission line intensity ratios involving
3s^23p^4 - 3s^23p^33d transitions in the 180-223 A wavelength range. These
ratios are subsequently compared with observations of a solar active region,
obtained during the 1995 flight Solar EUV Research Telescope and Spectrograph
(SERTS). The version of SERTS flown in 1995 incorporated a multilayer grating
that enhanced the instrumental sensitivity for features in the 170 - 225 A
wavelength range, observed in second-order between 340 and 450 A. This
enhancement led to the detection of many emission lines not seen on previous
SERTS flights, which were measured with the highest spectral resolution (0.03
A) ever achieved for spatially resolved active region spectra in this
wavelength range. However, even at this high spectral resolution, several of
the Fe XI lines are found to be blended, although the sources of the blends are
identified in the majority of cases. The most useful Fe XI electron density
diagnostic line intensity ratio is I(184.80 A)/I(188.21 A). This ratio involves
lines close in wavelength and free from blends, and which varies by a factor of
11.7 between N_e = 10^9 and 10^11 cm^-3, yet shows little temperature
sensitivity. An unknown line in the SERTS spectrum at 189.00 A is found to be
due to Fe XI, the first time (to our knowledge) this feature has been
identified in the solar spectrum. Similarly, there are new identifications of
the Fe XI 192.88, 198.56 and 202.42 A features, although the latter two are
blended with S VIII/Fe XII and Fe XIII, respectively.

"  During their first observational run, the two Advanced LIGO detectors
attained an unprecedented sensitivity, resulting in the first direct detections
of gravitational-wave signals and GW151226, produced by stellar-mass binary

combined results from two independent search techniques were used in this
study: the first employs a matched-filter algorithm that uses a bank of filters
covering the GW signal parameter space, while the second is a generic search
for GW transients (bursts). No GWs from IMBHBs were detected, therefore, we
constrain the rate of several classes of IMBHB mergers. The most stringent
limit is obtained for black holes of individual mass $100\,M_\odot$, with spins
aligned with the binary orbital angular momentum. For such systems, the merger
rate is constrained to be less than $0.93~\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}\,yr}^{-1}$ in
comoving units at the $90\%$ confidence level, an improvement of nearly 2
orders of magnitude over previous upper limits.

"  The nuclear incompressibility $K_\infty$ is deduced from measurements of the
Isoscalar Giant Monopole Resonance (ISGMR) in medium-heavy nuclei, and the
resulting value turns out to be model dependent. Since the considered nuclei
have neutron excess, it has been suggested that the model dependence is due to
the different behaviour of the symmetry energy in different models. To clarify
this issue, we make a systematic and careful analysis based on new Skyrme
forces which span a wide range of values for $K_\infty$, for the value of the
symmetry energy at saturation and for its density dependence. By calculating,
in a fully self-consistent fashion, the ISGMR centroid energy in $^{208}$Pb we
reach, for the first time within the non-relativistic framework, three
important conclusions: (i) the monopole energy, and consequently the deduced
value of $K_\infty$, depend on a well defined parameter related to the shape of
the symmetry energy curve and called $K_{sym}$; (ii) Skyrme forces of the type
of SLy4 predict $K_\infty$ around 230 MeV, in agreement with the Gogny force
(previous estimates using Skyrme interactions having been plagued by lack of
full self-consistency); (iii) it is possible to build forces which predict
$K_\infty$ around 250 MeV, although part of this increase is due to our poor

"  We present the first constraints on the parameter space of $SU(5)\times U(1)$
supergravity (in both no-scale and dilaton scenarios) which arise from the
recently announced limits on trilepton searches at the Tevatron. The trilepton
rate has been calculated for those points in parameter space which satisfy not
only the minimal theoretical and experimental LEP constraints, but also the
{\em combined} effect of the following indirect experimental constraints: (i)
the CLEO limits on the $b\to s\gamma$ rate, (ii) the long-standing limit on the
anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, (iii) the non-observation of anomalous
muon fluxes in underground detectors (``neutrino telescopes""), and (iv) the
electroweak LEP high-precision measurements in the form of the
$\epsilon_{1},\epsilon_b$ parameters. For $m_t=150\GeV$, the trilepton
constraint rules out some regions of parameter space with chargino masses as
high as $m_{\chi^\pm_1}\approx105\GeV$, although it is not possible to
establish a new absolute lower bound on the chargino mass. For $m_t=170\GeV$,
the simultaneous imposition of {\em all} of the above constraints excludes the
dilaton scenario completely, and leaves only a few allowed points in parameter
space in the no-scale scenario (with $m_{\tilde q}\approx m_{\tilde

the upcoming Tevatron run should probe some regions of parameter space with
chargino masses much beyond the reach of LEPII.

"  We calculate the baryon asymmetry created by the decay of a pseudo
Nambu-Goldstone boson whose interactions violate baryon number conservation.
Our results are in disagreement with previous results in the original
spontaneous baryogenesis models for the asymmetry produced by the decay of an
oscillating scalar field with B number violating derivative couplings; we find
that the net baryon number density is proportional to $\th_i^3$, where $\th_i$
is the amplitude of the PNGB-field in natural inflation at the onset of
reheating. We also discuss our disagreement with the interpretation of
$\dot\theta$ as an effective chemical potential for baryon number in
spontaneous baryogenesis models. While our calculation of the asymmetry is
carried out in the context of natural inflation our approach is generally valid
for baryogenesis models using decaying classical fields. In the Appendices, we
include a complete derivation of the number density of particles produced by
the decay of a classical scalar field; this number density is proportional to
the integral over momenta of the one pair production amplitude.

$\textrm{\AA}$)/[Gd(400 $\textrm{\AA}$)/W(50 $\textrm{\AA}$)]$_8$
heterostructures. The entropy change associated with the second order magnetic
phase transition was determined from the isothermal magnetization for numerous
temperatures and the appropriate Maxwell relation. The entropy change peaks at
a temperature of 284 K with a value of approximately 3.4 J/kg-K for a 0-30 kOe
field change; the full width at half max of the entropy change peak is about 70
K, which is significantly wider than that of bulk Gd under similar conditions.
The relative cooling power of this nanoscale system is about 240 J/kg, somewhat
lower than that of bulk Gd (410 J/kg). An iterative Kovel-Fisher method was
used to determine the critical exponents governing the phase transition to be
$\beta=0.51$, and $\gamma=1.75$. Along with a suppressed Curie temperature
relative to the bulk, the fact that the convergent value of $\gamma$ is that
predicted by the 2-D Ising model may suggest that finite size effects play an
important role in this system. Together, these observations suggest that
nanostructuring may be a promising route to tailoring the magnetocaloric
response of materials.

"  The main goal of network pruning is imposing sparsity on the neural network
by increasing the number of parameters with zero value in order to reduce the
architecture size and the computational speedup. In most of the previous
research works, sparsity is imposed stochastically without considering any
prior knowledge of the weights distribution or other internal network
characteristics. Enforcing too much sparsity may induce accuracy drop due to
the fact that a lot of important elements might have been eliminated. In this
paper, we propose Guided Attention for Sparsity Learning (GASL) to achieve (1)
model compression by having less number of elements and speed-up; (2) prevent
the accuracy drop by supervising the sparsity operation via a guided attention
mechanism and (3) introduce a generic mechanism that can be adapted for any
type of architecture; Our work is aimed at providing a framework based on
interpretable attention mechanisms for imposing structured and non-structured
sparsity in deep neural networks. For Cifar-100 experiments, we achieved the

"  We report the effect of system geometry on the clogging of granular material
flowing out of flat-bottomed hoppers with variable aperture size D. For such
systems, there exists a critical aperture size Dc at which there is a
divergence in the time for a flow to clog. To better understand the origins of
Dc, we perturb the system by tilting the hopper an angle Q and mapping out a
clogging phase diagram as a function of Q and D. The clogging transition
demarcates the boundary between the freely-flowing (large D, small Q) and
clogging (small D, large Q) regimes. We investigate how the system geometry
affects Dc by mapping out this phase diagram for hoppers with either a circular
hole or a rectangular narrow slit. Additionally, we vary the grain shape,
investigating smooth spheres (glass beads), compact angular grains (beach
sand), disk-like grains (lentils), and rod-like grains (rice). We find that the
value of Dc grows with increasing Q, diverging at pi-Qr where Qr is the angle
of repose. For circular apertures, the shape of the clogging transition is the
same for all grain types. However, this is not the case for the narrow slit
apertures, where the rate of growth of the critical hole size with tilt angle
depends on the material.

"  Boolean networks at the critical point have been a matter of debate for many
years as, e.g., scaling of number of attractor with system size. Recently it
was found that this number scales superpolynomially with system size, contrary
to a common earlier expectation of sublinear scaling. We here point to the fact
that these results are obtained using deterministic parallel update, where a
large fraction of attractors in fact are an artifact of the updating scheme.
This limits the significance of these results for biological systems where
noise is omnipresent. We here take a fresh look at attractors in Boolean
networks with the original motivation of simplified models for biological
systems in mind. We test stability of attractors w.r.t. infinitesimal
deviations from synchronous update and find that most attractors found under
parallel update are artifacts arising from the synchronous clocking mode. The
remaining fraction of attractors are stable against fluctuating response
delays. For this subset of stable attractors we observe sublinear scaling of
the number of attractors with system size.

"  BACKGROUND: Meniere's Disease (MD) is a condition of the inner ear with
symptoms affecting both vestibular and hearing functions. Some patients with MD
experience vestibular drop attacks (VDAs), which are violent falls caused by
spurious vestibular signals from the utricle and/or saccule. Recent surgical
work has shown that patients who experience VDAs also show distrupted utricular
otolithic membranes. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine if
otolithic membrane damage alone is sufficient to induce spurious vestibular
signals, thus potentially eliciting VDAs and the vestibular dysfunction seen in
patients with MD. METHODS: We use a previously developed numerical model to
describe the nonlinear dynamics of an array of active, elastically coupled hair
cells. We then reduce the coupling strength of a selected region of the
membrane to model the effects of tissue damage. RESULTS: As we reduce the
coupling strength, we observe large and abrupt spikes in hair bundle position.
As bundle displacements from the equilibrium position have been shown to lead
to depolarization of the hair-cell soma and hence trigger neural activity, this
spontaneous activity could elicit false detection of a vestibular signal.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this numerical model suggest that otolithic
membrane damage alone may be sufficient to induce VDAs and the vestibular
dysfunction seen in patients with MD. Future experimental work is needed to
confirm these results in vitro.

"  It has been claimed that Period-Luminosity relations derived from infrared
observations of Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) Cepheids are less dependent on the
metallicity of the Cepheids. In this work, infrared observations of LMC
Cepheids from the SAGE survey are combined with OGLE II optical observation to
model and predict mass-loss rates. The mass-loss rates are fit to the data and
are predicted to range from about 10^{-12} to 10^{-7}M_\odot/yr; however, the
rates depend on the assumed value of the dust-to-gas ratio. By comparing the
relations derived from observations to the relations derived from predicted
infrared stellar luminosities from the mass-loss model, it is shown mass loss
affects the structure and scatter of the infrared Period-Luminosity relation.
Mass loss produces shallower slopes of the infrared relations and a lower zero
point. There is also evidence for non-linearity in the predicted
Period-Luminosity relations, and it is argued that mass loss produces larger
infrared excess at lower periods, which affects the slope and zero point,
making the PL relations more linear in the wavelength range of 3.6 to 5.8
micron. Because the dust-to-gas ratio is metallicity dependent and mass loss
may have a metallicity dependence, infrared Period-Luminosity relations have
additional uncertainty due to metallicity.

"  Low-latitude rainfall variability on the daily to intraseasonal timescale is
often related to tropical waves, including convectively coupled equatorial
waves, the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), and tropical disturbances. Despite
the importance of rainfall variability for vulnerable societies in tropical
Africa, the relative influence of tropical waves for this region is largely
unknown. This article presents the first systematic comparison of the impact of
six wave types on precipitation over northern tropical Africa during the
transition and full monsoon seasons, using two satellite products and a dense
rain gauge network. Composites of rainfall anomalies in the different datasets
show} comparable modulation intensities in the West Sahel and at the Guinea
Coast, varying from less than 2 to above 7 mm/d depending on the wave type.
African Easterly Waves (AEWs) and Kelvin waves dominate the 3-hourly to daily
timescale and explain 10-30% locally. On longer timescales (7-20d), only the
MJO and equatorial Rossby (ER) waves remain as modulating factors and explain
about up to one third of rainfall variability. Eastward inertio-gravity waves
and mixed Rossby-gravity (MRG) waves are comparatively unimportant. An analysis
of wave superposition shows that low-frequency waves (MJO, ER) in their wet
phase amplify the activity of high-frequency waves (TD, MRG) and suppress them
in the dry phase. The results stress that more attention should be paid to
tropical waves when forecasting rainfall over northern tropical Africa.
